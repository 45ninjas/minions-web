Frames in here I felt where interesting. The original purpose of this file
was to track some frames that I thought would be interesting to see what the neural
network does with them.

For example, the first one. It's a 'silhouette of a minion' What kind of influence
does colour have? If I replaced all black with yellow would it change the outcome?

However this very quickly (3nd entry) tuned into frames that are interesting to me.

If you found an interesting frame that you think should be here, let me know.

=== Noteworthy frames ===

302		Silhouette of a minion.

832		Minions are blurry and Gru is sad (a few seconds before you cried.)

621		Gru realizes that counting to three won't work. Next
		scene he is babysitting at dance class.

382		This is what we are asking people to do. Stare at a
		computer and press Y or N... Stanley parable anyone?

775		Yes, that's a minion. However it's very unclear. It would be awesome if the
		neural network can guess this one.

1107	Gru just found out minions are actually yellow, not yellowish orange.

1105	Gru realized he is holding the F***ING MOON!

512		This is just a cool shot. Look at it. The framing, atmosphere and tone.
		It's so cool in fact. It's now a desktop wallpaper.

149		Another cool shot, What is he looking at? This is NOT a desktop wall
		paper because it has minions in it.

1156	Jump!!?

1154	The girls have seen Fortnight for the first time. Anges is one of the 10
		yearolds who plays that junk. Margo, industry experts, just about to laugh
		their face off at it. Finally, Edith (like	me) is pissed off that fortnight
		stole all my f***ing cheep ills in PUBG.

595		What is that?

866		Minon is all orange.

153		Only minion heads are seen.

488		That face though, did someone say a rude joke?

743		STOP [added to error offline frames]
